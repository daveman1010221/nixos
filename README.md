# nixos
This repo contains files for setting up NixOS, including a bare-metal bash
installation script and a full configuration.nix for the system. It also
contains a flake.nix that is the basis for a secure build sandbox for rust
projects. Probably best to fork this repo if you want to use/modify its
contents.
